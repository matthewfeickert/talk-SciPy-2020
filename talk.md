# Self notes while writing talk

- Ensure that your talk will be relevant to a broad range of people. If your talk is on a particular Python package or piece of software, it should useful to more than a niche group.
- Include links to source code, articles, blog posts, or other writing that adds context to the presentation.
- If you've given a talk, tutorial, or other presentation before, include that information as well as a link to slides or a video if they're available.
- .bold[SciPy talks are generally 25 minutes] with 2-3 minutes for questions. Please keep the length of time in mind as you structure your outline.
- Your talk should not be a commercial for your companyâ€™s product. However, you are welcome to talk about how your company solved a problem, or notable open-source projects that may benefit attendees.

.bold[Use:] Multiple disjoint _channels_ (or regions) of binned distributions with multiple _samples_ contributing to each with additional (possibly shared) systematics between sample estimates

.bold[Main pieces:]

- .blue[Main Poisson p.d.f. for bins observed in all channels]

# Formation definition

Following Hopcroft and Ullman (1979, p. 148), a (one-tape) Turing machine can be formally defined as a 7-tuple $M=(Q,\Gamma,b,\Sigma,\delta, q\_0, F)$, where
- $Q$ is a finite, non-empty set of states;
- $\Gamma$ is a finite, non-empty set of tapes alphabet symbols;
- $b \in \Gamma \setminus \\{b\\}$ is the set of input symbols, that is, the set of symbols allowed to appear in the initial tape contents;
- $q\_0 \in Q$ is the initial state;
- $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of final states or accepting states. The initial tape contents is said to be accepted by $M$ if it eventually halts in a state from $F$.
- $\delta: (Q \setminus F) \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \\{L,R\\}$ is the state transition function.
